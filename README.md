PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Memory card game is created in XCode 15.4 using SwiftUI and Swift Foundation.

It's created in Mode-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.

Game rule is to match 2 identical cards with the same emoji image. 

Dealing, flipping and chosing the cards have special animations.

Player collects points for matching 2 identical cards, and gets extra bonus points for matching them in within 6 seconds (faster he picks the cards, more bonus points he gets).
